# MINIO_ROOT_USER and MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD sets the root account for the MinIO server.
# This user has unrestricted permissions to perform S3 and administrative API operations on any resource in the deployment.
# Omit to use the default values 'minioadmin:minioadmin'.
# MinIO recommends setting non-default values as a best practice, regardless of environment

MINIO_ROOT_USER=myminioadmin
MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD="This server is not exposed to the outside world, so it does not matter if your password is made public."

# MINIO_VOLUMES sets the storage volume or path to use for the MinIO server.

MINIO_VOLUMES="/mnt/data"

# MINIO_OPTS sets any additional commandline options to pass to the MinIO server.

MINIO_OPTS="--console-address :9001"
